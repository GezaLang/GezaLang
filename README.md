## About Me

With a passion for both Data Science and Mathematics, I strive to build models and solutions grounded in solid theory and practical application. My goal is to tackle complex, real-world problems through data, while drawing on the mathematical rigor that makes for robust and reliable insights.

- **Education:** Currently studying Data Science and Mathematics @ KU Ingolstadt-Eichstätt
- **Career Aspiration:** To contribute to the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science, with a strong mathematical foundation  
- **Technical Skills:** Python, Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning, Mathematical Modeling, Data Visualization, SQL, and more
