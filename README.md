# Welcome To My GitHub

Hey, I'm Lukas and 
I'm currently studying Data Science and Mathematics at KU Ingolstadt-Eichstätt. I enjoy digging into data, building models, and figuring out how math can help solve real-world problems. This space is where I share some of the projects I've worked on—mostly things I've built during uni or in my free time.

## About Me

I’ve always been drawn to the mix of theory and application. Whether it’s optimizing algorithms or analyzing data, I like working on problems that require both structure and creativity. My background in mathematics helps me approach data science with a solid foundation, and I’m always looking for ways to make models not just accurate, but understandable and useful.

- **Education:** B.Sc. in Data Science and Mathematics (in progress)  
- **Interests:** Machine Learning, Scientific Computing, Mathematical Modeling  
- **Tools I Use:** Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and whatever else gets the job done
